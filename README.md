2.  **The Sedentary Cycle:** The average user spends **16 hours/day** sedentary.
3.  **The Sleep Trade-off:** There is a strong negative correlation (**-0.60**) between sedentary time and sleep. Users aren't sleeping less because they are active; they are losing sleep to sedentary behavior.

## Recommendations
* **Wind-Down Alerts:** Introduce app notifications to break "sedentary loops" in the evening (7-9 PM).
* **Sunday Recovery:** Launch "Active Recovery" marketing campaigns to boost Sunday engagement.
* **Holistic Wellness:** Position products not just as fitness trackers, but as "Rest & Recovery" guardians.
